          "On average, the Ivy League universities took 8.375 days to respond after the first hundred reported cases in the nation.",
          "This response rate equaled that of <c>China</c>, the first country to begin experiencing an outbreak in late January. 8 days after the first hundred reported cases, when the national number of cases had reached 2,863, the government mandated the closure of all schools.",
          "The Ivies’ responses were far slower than that of <c>South Korea</c>, which began experiencing an outbreak in late February. The South Korean government closed schools across the country when there were 602 cases, 2 days after the first hundred reported cases.",
          "The number of national cases at the time of Columbia’s response matches that of Italy, which has faced significant criticism for its delays. Italy began experiencing an outbreak in early March. They responded by closing schools when there were 3,858 cases, 11 days after the first hundred reported cases.",

          "The United States began experiencing an outbreak in mid-March, long after effects had been seen in China, South Korea, and Italy. The lack of coordinated national response led to delays in school closures, discrepancies in state recommendations, and lack of proactive efforts to inform university students of social distancing practices, according to experts.",
